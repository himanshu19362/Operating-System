Process : Program under execution.

Why we need process : To let the user perform a task in computer.

How OS creates a process:

-> Loads the program and static data into the RAM.

-> Allocate Runtime Stack : Stack is a part of memory which stores local variables , function arguments and return values.

-> Allocate Heap : Heap is a part of memory for dynamic allocation of memory.

-> Performs I/O tasks : Sets up where and how input , output , error handling will be done.  

-> Now main() will be executed by the CPU.

Process Architecture: It consists of several things which are : 

-> Text : Compiled code is stored here .

-> Data : Global Variables are stored here . 

-> Heap : All the dynamically data is allocated memory here . 

-> Stack : Here , all the local variables , return values etc are stored and recursion is possible because of this.

Attributes of Process : Used to differentiate between different processes.

Process Table : 
-> It is a table created by the OS which contains information about all the processes that are running in the system. 

-> It is an array of Process Control Block.

-> Process Table is stored in RAM .

Process Control Block : It is a data structure that stores all the information about a process . It stores the following information 

-> Process Id : Unique Id given to every process

-> Program Counter : Address of instruction that has to be executed. It goes to the address , fetches the instruction , increments 
   the counter and executes the fetched instruction.

-> Process State : It stores whether the current process is in new state , wait state , run state etc.

-> Priority : It defines the priority of the current process .

-> Registers : Stores the values of process specific registers.

-> Open File List : Stores information about the files that the current process has opened. 

Process State : Different Stages of a process .

-> NEW : When program is being converted into a process . 

-> READY : Process is occupied memory in RAM and is present in Ready Queue.

-> RUNNING : When CPU is allocated to the process .

-> WAITING : When we wait for an I/O operation to get completed.

-> TERMINATE : When process is finished .

Job Queue : It contains all the processes that are in New state . 

Job Scheduler : It is a module which schedules process in Job Queue into Ready State. (Long Term Scheduler)

CPU Scheduler : It is a module which schedules process in Ready Queue to Running State. (Short Term Scheduler)

Waiting Queue : It stores all the process in Waiting state.
