How OS boots up: 
-> Power On: Electricity goes to power supply which supplies electricity to hardware.

-> CPU gets initialize and starts executing BIOS . 

-> BIOS is a set of instructions which is stored in BIOS chip connected to processor. It does the following:
   1) It will Power on Self Test ie... it makes sure that all hardware divices are working well.
   2) Initializes video card and other devices .
   3) May display BIOS on screen.
   4) Identify the boot device(hardware where bootloader is present) and loads the bootloader in RAM.
      Bootloader can be present in MBR(Master Boot Record) which is the 0th index of disc or EFI which is a partition in disc.

-> Bootloader is a program that loads the OS in the memory . It also switches system from real mode to protected mode . 

Registers : Memory storage in CPU . 

Difference between 32 bit and 64 bit OS:
-> 32 bit OS means that the registers in processor will be of 32 bits and in 64 bit OS , the processors will have 64 bit registers.

Advantages of 64 bit OS:

-> Addressable Memory : 32 bit OS can store 2^32 different unique addresses which is 4GB . So , if RAM is greater than 4GB , no significant performance improvement . But 
   64 bit OS can support RAM with greater memory and it will give better performance . 

-> Compatibility : 64 bit CPU can run in both 32 bit as well as 64 bit OS but 32 bit CPU can only run in 32 bit OS.

-> Performance : 64 bit processors are fast because 8 bytes of data can be executed in 1 instruction cycle whereas only 4 bytes of data 
   can executed in one instruction cycle .

-> Better graphics : 8 byte graphic calculations make graphic extensive apps run faster.

Storage:
-> Primary Memory: Registers, Cache , Main Memory/RAM
-> Secondary Memory : Electronic , Magnetic , Optical Disk , magnetic tapes.

Comparison between Storage:

-> Cost: Registers > Cache > RAM > Disk . This is because Registers provide fast access to data .

-> Speed : Registers > Cache > RAM > Disk  

-> Storage Size : Registers < Cache < RAM < Disk 

-> Primary memory is volatile (it is empty when computer is shut down) whereas secondary memory is non-volatile.
